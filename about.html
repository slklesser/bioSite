				Kristin is a 28 year old girl that has been diagnosed with Cerebral Palsey, which is basically a brain disorder that affects ones ability to move or balance.  In Kristin's case, her diagnosis extends to both physical and mental capabilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kristin is almost always happy. She loves to laugh and listen to tv shows and movies.  She lives a pretty simple life, but does have difficulties in every day living, due to being blind, more or less paralyzed and having seizures..  She is supported by her family and caregivers for everything she needs to do.  She gets massage therapy three times a week and music therapy twice a week.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite all of her hardships, pain and limitations, she remains a very positive influence on others.  She is like an angel on earth, because she is so innocent and pure.  When people get to know Kristin, they love her and love being around her. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Kristin has had several surgeries, one hospital stay resulted in her getting bed sores and another caused her to stop drinking fluids, due to choking/aspirationâ€¦ which, in turn, resulted in another surgery to have a g-tube inserted so that she could have fluid intake without being fearful of not being able to breathe.
			</p>	
			<p>	
				Kristin basically just enjoys life without any drama or emotional upset.  She is really just the sweetest soul.
